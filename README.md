A machine learning project for classifying news articles into predefined categories using traditional models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. Includes performance evaluation using standard metrics.

# News Article Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying news articles into predefined categories using classical machine learning models. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of different algorithms on a real-world text classification task.

## Project Overview

We use a labeled dataset of news articles and apply the following machine learning models:

- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The models are evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, vectorization using TF-IDF)
- Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers
- Performance comparison and analysis
- Clean, modular Python code using scikit-learn and pandas

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib / seaborn (optional for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experiments and reporting)

**Note:** This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to deepen my understanding of classical machine learning techniques applied to text classification.
